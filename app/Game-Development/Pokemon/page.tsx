          Description:
        </div>
        Pokemon #00B6D5 is a playful, one-battle Pokemon-style game where players face off against the band Weezer.
        Developed in collaboration with a friend who handled the art and animations, I was solely responsible for all programming, including battle mechanics, state management, UI, and effects.
        This project helped me develop skills with Unity, C# scripting, and turn-based game systems, while also deepening my experience in solo development, debugging, and integrating custom animations into gameplay.

          Abstract:
        </div>
        Pokemon #00B6D5 is a quirky and unforgettable one-on-one battle experience where players face off in a single, high-stakes Pokemon match against none other than the legendary alt-rock band Weezer.
        Set in a nostalgic arena with a pixel-perfect vibe, the game blends strategic turn-based combat with absurd humor and band-themed easter eggs.
        Whether you're using type advantages or just vibing to Island in the Sun, this surreal encounter is less about victory and more about the journeyâ€”and maybe catching a guitar solo along the way.
