        </div>
        Over the span of 10 weeks, I led a group of five students in designing and developing a custom party video game for our Software Engineering II course.
        Built using the Unity game engine, the game features C# scripting and utilizes the .NET framework for multiplayer functionality.

          Abstract:
        </div>
        Ribbit Royale is an exciting and whimsical online party game designed to bring players together through fun, competitive, and engaging multiplayer minigames.
        Featuring a playful art style and a variety of unique, frog-themed interactions, the game invites players to experience amusing challenges that leverage the distinct abilities of frogsâ€”such as swinging with their tongues, licking to interact with the environment, and even eating other players or flies.

        </div>
        As the Project Manager and Gameplay Developer, I designed and implemented 2 of the 3 minigames: "Lickity Split" and "Swamp Spotting".
        This included implementing multiplayer synchronization as well as configuring the physics engine and designing a tongue swinging mechanic, which allows players to utilize swinging as means to gain speed and reach the goal at breakneck speeds.
