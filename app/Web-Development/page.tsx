      A Fabric Mod for Minecraft that enables in-game TCP networking and web hosting capabilities.
      This mod leverages low-level socket programming to establish direct TCP connections from within the Minecraft game environment.
      It allows players or server administrators to serve custom HTML-based websites directly from the game itself—without needing any external web server.

      In a 24 hour hackathon with 3 teammates, I helped create a web application to remove the clutter from bloated recipe websites.
      No longer will you have to scroll through an endless feed of life stories, popup ads, and SEO-stuffed paragraphs just to find a list of ingredients.
      Simply enter the url of a desired recipe and viola! All the important information with none of the excess.
      (Complete with calculations for a meal's nutritional information)

      Working at the Bittner Development Group, I worked on interactive textbooks for clients.
      I engineered web features and performed Quality Assurance + DevOps for over 20 interactive chapters.
      I coded questions into 5+ textbooks on Norton’s online textbook platform (PCAT) via HTML and utilized JavaScript and HTML to program 4 textbook chapters of my own.

      In my Oregon State University Web Development and Introduction to Databases classes, I designed 8 websites.
      These websites were originally designed using only HTML, but grew to use increasing amounts of JavaScript and eventually incorperated dynamic content via Handlebars.js.
