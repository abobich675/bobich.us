          Description:
        </div>
        A Fabric-based Minecraft mod that transforms the game into a live coding sandbox for web development.
        By embedding a lightweight TCP server directly into the game world, this mod allows players and server operators to host static HTML/CSS websites without relying on any external infrastructure.
        When the game/server launches, a thread will be created to listen for HTTP requests at a specified port.
        Then, within the game, players can build their own website structure and run a command to add the website to a list accessible through the hosted port.
        With simple commands and in-game building mechanics, users can:
        <ul className='list-disc list-inside p-2.5'>
          <li>Establish direct TCP socket connections using Java’s networking libraries</li>
          <li>Serve custom HTML pages over HTTP directly from Minecraft</li>
          <li>Construct &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt; elements as 3D block structures, using signs and lecterns to embed text and styles</li>
          <li>Apply CSS-like styling by stacking blocks to define classes and rules visually</li>
        </ul>

        This mod serves as an interesting proof of concept that put my networking skills to the test.
        By combining low-level socket programming with Minecraft’s game mechanics, it challenged me to bridge the gap between in-game logic and real-world web protocols—resulting in a creative and technically rewarding project.

          Abstract:
        </div>
        A Fabric Mod for Minecraft that enables in-game TCP networking and web hosting capabilities.
        This mod leverages low-level socket programming to establish direct TCP connections from within the Minecraft game environment.
        It allows players or server administrators to serve custom HTML-based websites directly from the game itself—without needing any external web server.
        More than just a networking tool, it acts as a visual and interactive proof of concept—designed to help you understand the fundamentals of web development by rendering HTML elements like divs and spans as physical blocks within the game world.
